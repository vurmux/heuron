# MEta Machine Emulator

**This project is currently in very early stage of development.**

This project implements a generic constructor of CPU emulators.
The main idea is in dynamical creation and binding of basic elements (registers, memory, stack etc.) and instruction set. After this process the needed emulator is stored in host memory.

You can find the simple pseudo-GUI example in root directory of this repository in file meme-curses.py. It needs **curses** library to run.
